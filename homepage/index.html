                    Hi, I'm <span class="name">Owen</span>.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a computer science student enrolled in the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore in Aug 2022, 
                    Even though I have no formal training prior to this, 
                    I am a fast learner 
                    who enjoys learning new stuff on my own and creating programs.
                    Which includes multiple projects that helped my team to do their work more easily during National Service.
                    You can find more information about me in the other sections.
